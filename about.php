<h2>About the USGwnWeb Project </h2>
<a href="http://google.com">Link </a>
<p>In March and April, 1996, a group of genealogists from Kentucky began organizing web pages for each county in their similar pages. Almost every county in the US and Canada has a GenWeb page. Then the GenWeb project went world wide and there are similar pages for most countries on our planet. All GenWeb pages are staffed by volunteers helping people to find their families.
